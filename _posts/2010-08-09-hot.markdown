Good gravy it's hot. I moved closer to my workplace in early June.
On days like today, I'm in the unenviable position of walking or biking
to work and sweating like a pig in both directions, or driving my car
and paying for parking. Today thrift won out, but the pits on this shirt
are paying for it.
