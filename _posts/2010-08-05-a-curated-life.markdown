In 2010-2011, I hope to have the guts to spend time on things about which I care deeply
rather than wasting hours fiddling at things that I find easy. Sometime a curator has to
say 'no' to things that are otherwise good enough because he/she has a more worthwhile vision.
I have to learn to be a better curator of my time.
