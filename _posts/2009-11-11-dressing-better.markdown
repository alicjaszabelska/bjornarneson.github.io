So I've been trying to dress better. Never having had a job that required me to wear a suit/tie every day (and still not quite having such) most of my suits have languished in the closet. A few weeks ago, I thought it would be a good idea to step it up a notch. Pull out those suits. Iron a shirt or two. I may be comparatively overdressed, but It makes me feel great.

Plus, I get to tell the story about my $25 Hart Schaffner Marx.
