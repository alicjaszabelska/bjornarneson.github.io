We've got a few more days (at least) of patio weather here in Minnesota. Take advantage of it. 

The birds at our backyard feeder have been stocking up on corn and sunflower seeds. A few pesky squirrels have been stealing the ripe raspberries reachable from the fence and the bright orange seed pods on our little star magnolia tree. They know that these days are dwindling, too.
