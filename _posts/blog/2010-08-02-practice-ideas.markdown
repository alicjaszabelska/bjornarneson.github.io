This summer I've been trying to get my golf game back in shape. Most of last year was
a complete bust due to the herniated lumbar disc (March 2009) that bothered me until
late summer--about the time when my golf fever has broken.

Thus far, I am relatively happy with my play. My handicap index isn't quite as low as 
I'd like. I currently play off 5--would like to be closer to 2. In reality, I may not
play enough to ever get that low again. I probably drop 2-3 shots a round that one 
can only pull off when playing 54-72 holes per week.

In any case, I've been following a more thoughtful practice routine, working methodically
on various aspects of my game. Last week, I finished Bob Rotella's book _Golf Is Not a
Game of Perfect_, which has given me a new outlook on the game. I also read his _Putting
Out of Your Mind_--another good book for the pathological perfectionist.

These are the ideas that I'm trying to execute in my full swing nowadays:

- Proper alignment to target (practice with alignment aids)
- One-piece takeaway (turn with my chest)
- Steeper shoulder turn (to avoid an unnaturally flat and laid off backswing)
