I migrated this site from [Drupal](http://drupal.org) to [Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll) today. Given that this site is updated only infrequently, I thought
it might be a good idea to use a publishing system that doesn't need quite as much ongoing attention as Drupal.
I managed to port the Neewee theme in use on the previous site to Jekyll. Will give more details when I have the opportunity.
