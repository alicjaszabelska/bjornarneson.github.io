Today nearly 20 inches of snow fell in St. Paul. We spent part of the morning
watching fools try to turn the corner outside and speed their little Hondas
up the hill (the one covered by a foot of snow). Fail. For my part, I managed 
to get outside once to run down to the food co-op to pick up some supplies 
before they closed up. Three square meals today, all prepared by yours truly:

- **Breakfast**: garlic scrambled eggs; brown rice; baby lettuce salad  
- **Lunch**: corn tamales; cut okra  
- **Dinner**: walnut-crusted chicken breasts; roasted potatos, carrots, onion, 
and shallots; dinner roll

The lady has already requested a repeat performance for breakfast tomorrow
morning. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.
