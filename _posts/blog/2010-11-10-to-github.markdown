Because I can't leave well enough alone, I have migrated this blog to 
[Github](github.com) for a few reasons:

1. Blog hosting at Github is free.
2. My web content is now under version control.
3. I can write and edit content, structure, and style from within my
   preferred text editor (currently Textwrangler for OSX).
4. I'm trying to learn Git, and this is a great excuse to play around
   with my own site before using the tool to manage someone else's. 
   [Drupal](drupal.org) will be going Git soon and I want to learn 
   the ins and outs of Git for that project.
5. The blog is processed by the very excellent [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) 
   rendering engine. Basically, I feed it Markdown files and it 
   spits out static HTML. On the client end, it feels very fast 
   and I can use nice clean code to both author and administer the blog.
