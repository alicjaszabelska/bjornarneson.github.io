Had our first week of indoor volleyball league last night.
After playing sand all summer, I had forgotten how much fun 
it is to play on a hard court, where my body generally moves 
in the direction and speed that my brain instructs. The team 
went 0-3 last night, but we tend to start slow and finish 
strong. Whoo-ahh.
