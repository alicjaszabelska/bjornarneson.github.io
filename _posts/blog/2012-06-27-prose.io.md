title: A new web interface to Jekyll
---

I recently discovered [prose.io](http://prose.io), a web-based interface to my Jekyll blog hosted at Github. I love Jekyll for its simplicity, security, and flexibility, but was never quite satisfied with the local git workflow needed to add a new post to my site.

It appears that Prose.io has solved this problem, at least minimally. I can add new posts, edit any text-based file in my Github repositories, all within a convenient web-based Markdown editor. I still may need to revert to my text editor and local filesystem in order to add rich media assets, but Prose.io manages Markdown files with ease.

With any luck, Prose.io will increase the frequency with which I post to this blog. Stay tuned!
