I returned home to Minneapolis yesterday from a rural development conference[^1] in Billings, Montana. I saw my first
snow of the year in Billings, and the wintry temperatures seemed to have followed me back to Minnesota. 
I was hoping to fit in one more round of golf for the year--may have to pack the clubs away until April.

[^1]: Met a lot of very passionate and smart people at the Northern Plains Initiative Conference presented by Rural Dynamics.
