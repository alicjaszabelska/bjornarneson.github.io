Because both visitors to this blog are related to me by blood, they
probably already know that I'm getting married in t-minus 18 days. If
you haven't checked out our [informational wedding site](http://weddingwire.com/brittanyandbjorn), give it a go.
I'm looking forward to the day--there is too much to do, but it can't 
come soon enough.
