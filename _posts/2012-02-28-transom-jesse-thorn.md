> The creepy thing to call this is networking, but I much prefer to call it connecting with people you like. You donâ€™t have to have an agenda. When you find someone whose work you like, tell them. When you meet someone you think is interesting, meet them again. The internet is built on community and conversation. That is expected. Engage that back-and-forth. Offer someone a hand, and expect nothing in return. Do something cool with someone you think is cool because the thing will end up cool. You never know what you might end up with.

P.S. Jesse (@PutThisOn) retweeted me a few days ago. I'm a second-degree Twitter rockstar now, right?
