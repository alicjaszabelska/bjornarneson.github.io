<p>Played golf with one of my teachers this evening. Great night for being outside! I hit a lot of solid shots on the front nine&#8212;hit the green in regulation on holes 2-9. Having not played in nearly a month (work/wedding/honeymoon/exhaustion), I got a little physically tired by hole 12/13. I had also already walked three miles earlier in the day (my round-trip commute to work). All in all, it was a decent round. I just wish that I could have sustained my concentration through to 18.</p>
