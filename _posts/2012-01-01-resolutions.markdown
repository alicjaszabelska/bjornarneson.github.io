In 2012, I want to do **less** of these things:

1. Distracting myself with cosmically unimportant stuff
2. Chasing after the internet

I want to do **more** of these things:

1. Walking and biking
2. Reading fiction
3. Making physical things with my bare hands
4. Being present and mindful in my home and with my family

I want to do fewer things but do them more deeply.
