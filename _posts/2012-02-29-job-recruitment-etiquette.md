> "I am so grateful when I am rejected, because then I can focus my energy elsewhere. I understand that there are no laws that require companies to send notice; I am simply appealing to whatever human decency they may have.

> "Leaving a person in limbo is cruel. I'm not asking anyone to print a postcard, put postage on it and mail it to me; an e-mail would suffice. I'm asking them to push a few buttons on a keyboard. If they are afraid that they are going to hurt my feelings, let me assure them that I can handle it.

> "I want to acknowledge that there are some companies who are treating applicants with dignity and respect -- in my experience, about one in 10. I especially want to thank the hiring manager who took the time to call me when I didn't get the job and who gave me feedback for future reference."

This writer's experience mirrors my own. I've been jobhunting for several months and have found that waiting is the hardest part. I'm particularly grateful to the people who have had the guts to call me personally and let me know that someone else had been hired. Conversely, I worked my tail off for a series of three interviews with another local nonprofit organization, ended up among the finalists for a leadership position, and never heard another word--not even a form letter or email. Ouch!

Like the writer, my desire to work for good people is deepened even when they deliver unwanted news. They will not have seen the last of me!
