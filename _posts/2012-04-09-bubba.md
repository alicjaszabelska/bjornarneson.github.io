If you are a golf fan, you were probably tuned in to the final round of the 2012 Masters yesterday afternoon. It was an 
unbelievable duel between two great men, Bubba Watson and Louis Oosthuizen. Both finished regulation play tied at 10 under par.
Watson would eventually prevail on the second hole of a sudden death playoff. But that isn't the point of this post.

Bubba Watson is among the greatest natural talents on the PGA Tour today. He famously claims to hate practicing at the range. 
His swing is an unconventional and unrestrained lash at the ball. He intentionally curves nearly every shot he plays, even when it is not strictly necessary. Bubba took his last golf lesson at age 10.

He is a man who clearly enjoys **playing golf** more than **playing golf swing**. This is a philosophy that more better players should adopt. Pay more attention to putting the ball in the hole and less to the good looks of your backswing.

Bubba was a weepy mess when he won yesterday. I probably would have been also, if not for the fact that I was watching at my inlaws' home after Easter dinner. Bubba is the people's champ!
