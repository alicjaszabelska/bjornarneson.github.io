Choral singing has been a huge part of my life since high school. Beginning this September, I have been a part of a small group called the Elm Quintet. 
As it happens, we have our first gig coming up in a couple weeks. We're collaborating with an early music group led by Phil Rukavina (lute).
Lots of great early music on the program! Details available at:
