Long story short, I found an iPhone in the recycling bin at work 
and have adopted it as my own. 

No idea as to why the previous owner threw it away--perhaps she/he 
acquired a newer model (this one is the 2G, an early version) or 
decided to abandon AT&T as a service provider. 

0. Borrow a cable to get some juice into the battery.
1. Reset the device to factory standards (don't worry, previous
   owner--I resisted the temptation to read all of your old
   email and/or have fun with your Facebook account).
2. Jailbreak and unlock the 2G with Redsn0w so that I can use
   a non-AT&T sim card.
3. Acquire and install T-mobile prepaid sim card (~$32/month for more minutes
   and texts than I'll ever use).
4. Enjoy someone else's "obsolete" technology.
