Despite my non-existent knowledge of Ruby, I'm working on putting together
a Jekyll plugin that will parse Twitter XML and save a "daily digest" of my
tweets to the Jekyll system. I haven't quite worked this out yet, but will 
report back here when and if it happens.

In the mean time, if you, dear reader, have already figured this one out, 
drop me a line [@bjornarneson](http://twitter.com/bjornarneson).
